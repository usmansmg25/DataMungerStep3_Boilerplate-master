## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 3 - Database Engine Assignment

### Problem Statement

In the previous assignment 2, we extracted different parts of the query and stored the query parameters/parts in separate classes with properties and methods. 
The classes were given meaningful names like **AggregateFunctions, Restrictions, QueryParameter and QueryParser** based on to the operations they performed.

In this Assignment 3, we will 

    1. Read the header.  
    2. Identify the Data type of each field 

**Read the header**
The CSV file contains a set of data, where the first line is the header, for example: in our ipl.csv the following are the header 
**id, season, city, date, team1, team2, toss_winner, toss_decision, result, dl_applied, winner, win_by_runs, win_by_wickets, player_of_match, venue, umpire1, umpire2, umpire3** 

**Identify the Datatype of each field**
We cannot identify the data type of the field just by reading the header. We need to read a row which contains actual data.

All the data in the CSV file are in string format. We need to convert the nonstring data into its respective data type, this is needed because whenever we perform some sort of conditional operations we will be in need of the respective data type. 

For example, the following is the single line data of the CSV file 
**1, 2008, Bangalore, 2008-04-18, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Royal Challengers Bangalore, field, normal, 0, Kolkata Knight Riders, 140, 0, BB McCullum, M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Asad Rauf, RE Koertzen,**

here you can easily find data which is not a string **(for example 2008, 2008-04-18, 140 etc.,).** The numeric data should be converted into an integer or double. 

However, for this assignment, we will not try to convert date. It will be addressed in the next assignment.

**Note : Once you have cloned boilerplate from the given gitlab URL, import the project into eclipse. 
Your project’s test cases might show compile time errors for methods, as you have not written the complete code.**

### Expected Output
Display each column header along with its data type
     
                Enter the file name:
                (Input from User) data/ipl.csv
                
                Output
                id:java.lang.Integer
                season:java.lang.Integer
                city:java.lang.String
                date:java.lang.String
                team1:java.lang.String
                team2:java.lang.String
                toss_winner:java.lang.String
                toss_decision:java.lang.String
                result:java.lang.String
                dl_applied:java.lang.Integer
                winner:java.lang.String
                win_by_runs:java.lang.Integer
                win_by_wickets:java.lang.Integer
                player_of_match:java.lang.String
                venue:java.lang.String
                umpire1:java.lang.String
                umpire2:java.lang.String
                umpire3:java.lang.String

> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however, if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step3** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/stack_java_datamunging/DataMungerStep3_Boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step3`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step3 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step3`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step3` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-cts.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step3.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
